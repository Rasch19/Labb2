				<h3 id="dhead">Dota 2</h3>
				<p id="litentext">Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation
				   for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was 
				   a community-created mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in 
				   matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map. 
				   Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that feature unique abilities and 
				   different styles of play. During a match, a player and their team collects experience points, currency, and items for their
				   heroes in order to better fight heroes of the opposing team, attempting to push through their defenses. A team wins by 
				   being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".
